### Using the CTO Oracle

The CTO Oracle maintains complete project context to prevent the complexity issues we faced with Veritas. It can:

1. **Make architectural decisions** with full project awareness
2. **Track roadmap progress** and identify blockers
3. **Provide strategic guidance** based on current state
4. **Maintain continuity** across sessions

### Current Status

**Phase:** Foundation Complete - Passion Project Established
**Status:** Creative development when inspired, no artificial deadlines
**Achieved:**
- ✅ Complete game design document (1,821 lines)
- ✅ Advanced features blueprint (Pattern Chains, Echo Patterns, Stance System)
- ✅ Working prototype demonstrating core gameplay
- ✅ AI-powered development framework operational
- ✅ Official commitment to passion project approach
**Next Step:** Unity implementation when time and energy align
**Philosophy:** Art over commerce, community over scale, joy over pressure

### Key Principles

1. **Passion-Driven**: Create art because we love it, not for profit
2. **Text-Based First**: Every decision optimized for text gameplay
3. **Strategic Depth**: Complex decisions, simple interface
4. **Respect Player Time**: 25-35 minute runs, no grinding
5. **AI-Powered Development**: Leverage AI for creativity and consistency
6. **Community Focus**: Build for players who appreciate intelligent games
7. **No Pressure**: Work flows naturally around life circumstances

### Commands

```python
# Initialize CTO Oracle
from nexus_cto.src import get_cto_oracle
cto = get_cto_oracle()

# Get project status
status = cto.get_status_report()
print(status)

# Make a decision
decision = cto.make_decision("Implement advanced features or focus on core gameplay?")

# Update progress
cto.update_progress("M1", "Completed", "Design phase complete - prototype validated")
cto.update_progress("M2", "Next", "Unity setup and Stone Guardian implementation")
```

### Documentation Philosophy

- **Context is King**: Every decision needs full project context
- **Living Documents**: Documentation updates with development
- **Decision Tracking**: Every architectural choice is recorded with reasoning
- **No Silos**: All information accessible to the CTO Oracle

## Game Vision

**Nexus: Trial of Champions** is a premium mobile text-based roguelike where players face 10 legendary champions through strategic choices. Players make tactical decisions (Attack, Defend, Dodge, Analyze) to survive deadly patterns. Die, learn, master, conquer—through compelling narrative combat.

### **What Makes Nexus Special:**
- **Pattern Recognition Gameplay**: Learn boss telegraphs, not reflexes
- **Intelligent Combat**: Bosses adapt to your playstyle and remember mistakes
- **Strategic Depth**: Pattern Chains, Weak Points, and Stance Systems create endless replayability
- **Respect for Players**: No grinding, no ads, no predatory mechanics

- **Free Demo**: 3 bosses (Stone Guardian, Flame Archon, Ice Witch), 1 class
- **Premium Unlock**: $6.99 for full game (10 bosses, 5 classes) - if released
- **Target**: 500-1,000 players who genuinely love the experience
- **Experience**: Dark Souls pattern learning meets Reigns swipes meets Slay the Spire depth
- **Mission**: Create meaningful art that impacts players who appreciate intelligence

### **Play the Prototype:**
Experience the core gameplay now:
```bash
# Open the working prototype
open prototype/index.html
# Test in browser mobile view for authentic experience
```
**Proven Concept:** Fully playable Stone Guardian encounter that validates the text-based combat system

## Passion Project Philosophy

This project embraces the freedom that comes from creating art for art's sake:

- ✅ **Zero Pressure Development**: Work when inspired, rest when needed
- ✅ **Creative Freedom**: No market constraints, no publisher demands
- ✅ **Community Focus**: Build for players who appreciate intelligent games
- ✅ **Learning Journey**: Every challenge is an opportunity to grow
- ✅ **AI Collaboration**: Human vision + AI execution capabilities
- ✅ **Resource Respect**: Maximum $700 budget, no financial risk
- ✅ **Joy as Metric**: Success measured by fulfillment, not profit

Key Achievement: Created complete design, built working prototype, and established advanced feature roadmap while maintaining creative freedom and zero pressure.
