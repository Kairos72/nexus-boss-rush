# Nexus: Trial of Champions

*Premium Text-Based Roguelike - Dark Souls meets Reigns meets Slay the Spire*

## Quick Start

Welcome to Nexus: Trial of Champions development workspace. This is our command center for building a premium text-based mobile game that respects players.

### The Team
- **CEO (Partner)**: Vision, strategy, community building
- **CTO Oracle**: AI-powered technical leadership with full context
- **Builder (Claude)**: Rapid implementation and prototyping

### Using the CTO Oracle

The CTO Oracle maintains complete project context to prevent the complexity issues we faced with Veritas. It can:

1. **Make architectural decisions** with full project awareness
2. **Track roadmap progress** and identify blockers
3. **Provide strategic guidance** based on current state
4. **Maintain continuity** across sessions

### Current Status

**Phase:** Design Complete - Prototype Validated
**Focus:** Preparing Unity development environment
**Achieved:**
- ✅ Complete game design document (1,821 lines)
- ✅ Advanced features blueprint (Pattern Chains, Echo Patterns, Stance System)
- ✅ Working prototype demonstrating core gameplay
- ✅ AI-powered development framework operational
**Next Priority:** Unity project setup and text-based UI implementation
**Timeline Update:** On track for March-April 2026 launch (2 months ahead of schedule)

### Key Principles

1. **Text-Based First**: Every decision optimized for text gameplay
2. **Strategic Depth**: Complex decisions, simple interface
3. **Respect Player Time**: 25-35 minute runs, no grinding
4. **AI-Powered Development**: Leverage AI for speed and consistency
5. **Context Awareness**: Never lose project understanding

### Commands

```python
# Initialize CTO Oracle
from nexus_cto.src import get_cto_oracle
cto = get_cto_oracle()

# Get project status
status = cto.get_status_report()
print(status)

# Make a decision
decision = cto.make_decision("Implement advanced features or focus on core gameplay?")

# Update progress
cto.update_progress("M1", "Completed", "Design phase complete - prototype validated")
cto.update_progress("M2", "Next", "Unity setup and Stone Guardian implementation")
```

### Documentation Philosophy

- **Context is King**: Every decision needs full project context
- **Living Documents**: Documentation updates with development
- **Decision Tracking**: Every architectural choice is recorded with reasoning
- **No Silos**: All information accessible to the CTO Oracle

## Game Vision

**Nexus: Trial of Champions** is a premium mobile text-based roguelike where players face 10 legendary champions through strategic choices. Players make tactical decisions (Attack, Defend, Dodge, Analyze) to survive deadly patterns. Die, learn, master, conquer—through compelling narrative combat.

### **What Makes Nexus Special:**
- **Pattern Recognition Gameplay**: Learn boss telegraphs, not reflexes
- **Intelligent Combat**: Bosses adapt to your playstyle and remember mistakes
- **Strategic Depth**: Pattern Chains, Weak Points, and Stance Systems create endless replayability
- **Respect for Players**: No grinding, no ads, no predatory mechanics

- **Free Demo**: 3 bosses (Stone Guardian, Flame Archon, Ice Witch), 1 class
- **Premium Unlock**: $6.99 for full game (10 bosses, 5 classes)
- **Target**: 50-100K downloads, 25-35% conversion
- **Experience**: Dark Souls pattern learning meets Reigns swipes meets Slay the Spire depth

### **Play the Prototype:**
Experience the core gameplay now:
```bash
# Open the working prototype
open prototype/index.html
# Test in browser mobile view for authentic experience
```
**Proven Concept:** Fully playable Stone Guardian encounter that validates the text-based combat system

## Development Approach

Learned from Veritas:
- ✅ Clear project boundaries
- ✅ Persistent context management
- ✅ AI-powered development efficiency
- ✅ Documentation-first approach
- ✅ Agile iteration with strategic guidance
- ✅ Rapid prototyping for concept validation
- ✅ Intelligent feature design over speed mechanics

Key Achievement: Created complete design, built working prototype, and established advanced feature roadmap in just 2 days.
