# How the CTO Oracle Stays Updated

## The Magic: It's Mostly Automatic!

You don't need to do anything complicated. The CTO Oracle updates itself through several automatic methods:

---

## 🔄 **Automatic Updates (No Action Needed)**

### 1. **Conversation Tracking**
Every time we talk, the system automatically:
- ✅ Saves the conversation
- ✅ Extracts decisions made
- ✅ Identifies progress updates
- ✅ Detects new blockers

**Example:**
```
You: "Let's add dodge roll i-frames"
→ Auto-saved as decision
→ Updates combat system progress
→ Marks as next priority
```

### 2. **File Scanning**
The system automatically scans for:
- ✅ New Unity scripts created
- ✅ New assets added
- ✅ Milestone completions
- ✅ Progress indicators

**Example:**
```
Claude creates PlayerController.cs
→ Auto-detects new script
→ Updates progress: "Combat: 10% complete"
→ Notes: "Character controller implemented"
```

### 3. **Milestone Tracking**
When you complete milestones:
```
You: "M1 is done!"
→ Auto-updates roadmap
→ Calculates new progress percentage
→ Updates next milestone
```

---

## 📝 **When You DO Need to Tell It Something**

### 1. **Making Decisions**
Just say "I decided" or "We chose":
```
You: "I decided we'll use Midjourney for art"
→ Automatically logged as architectural decision
→ Added to decision log with reasoning
```

### 2. **External Activities**
When you do things outside our chat:
```
You: "I tested the game on iPhone"
→ Updates testing progress
→ Notes device feedback
```

### 3. **Changing Priorities**
When focus shifts:
```
You: "Let's pause UI and focus on combat"
→ Updates current focus
→ Reorders priorities
```

---

## 🎯 **Simple Commands You Can Use**

### **Update Progress**
```
"Mark M1 as complete"
"Combat system is 50% done"
"Boss 1 is finished"
```

### **Add Blockers**
```
"We're blocked on character art"
"Android build is failing"
```

### **Record Decisions**
```
"I decided to postpone co-op mode"
"We chose Unity over Unreal"
```

## 📊 **What the CTO Oracle Always Knows**

Without you telling it, it knows:

### **Project Status**
- Current phase and sprint
- Progress percentage
- Next milestone deadline
- Any blockers or risks

### **Technical Details**
- Number of scripts written
- Systems implemented
- Bugs found and fixed
- Performance metrics

### **Decision History**
- Every architectural choice
- Why decisions were made
- Alternatives considered
- Impact assessment

### **Team Activities**
- Who worked on what
- When things were completed
- What problems were solved
- What's currently in progress

## 🚀 **Example: A Day in the Life**

### **Morning (Automatic)**
```
8:00 AM - System auto-scans project
→ Sees 3 new scripts from Claude
→ Updates combat progress to 25%
→ Notes "Good progress on character controller"
```

### **Your Conversation (Semi-Automatic)**
```
You: "How are we doing?"
CTO Oracle: "Combat is 25% complete. Claude implemented character controller yesterday.
         Next priority: dodge roll implementation. No blockers."
```

### **Making Decision (Simple)**
```
You: "I want to add haptic feedback"
→ Auto-logged as decision
→ Added to combat system requirements
→ Estimated: +2 days development
```

### **Claude's Work (Automatic)**
```
Claude: "I added the dodge roll with i-frames"
→ Auto-detects new script
→ Updates combat progress to 40%
→ Marks M1 deliverable as complete
```

### **Evening Summary (Automatic)**
```
5:00 PM - Daily auto-summary
→ Progress: 40% on M1
→ Decisions made: 1
→ Blockers: 0
→ On track for milestone
```

## 🛠️ **Behind the Scenes**

The system uses:

1. **Conversation Parsers** - Extract meaning from our chats
2. **File Watchers** - Monitor project changes
3. **Context Managers** - Keep everything organized
4. **Decision Loggers** - Track all choices

**You don't need to understand these - they just work!**

---

## 📱 **Daily Reports (Optional)**

If you want, the CTO Oracle can send you:

- **Morning Briefing** (What's happening today)
- **Evening Summary** (What we accomplished)
- **Weekly Report** (Progress toward goals)

Just say: "Send me daily updates"

---

## ✅ **Your Role: Simple and Easy**

### **DO:**
- Talk normally about the project
- Say "I decided" when you make choices
- Mention when things are complete
- Ask "How are we doing?" anytime

### **DON'T:**
- Worry about updating context
- Keep separate notes
- Track progress manually
- Remember everything yourself

---

## 🎯 **The Bottom Line**

**The CTO Oracle is like having a perfect memory for your project.**

- ✅ It remembers everything automatically
- ✅ You just talk normally
- ✅ It understands and organizes
- ✅ You get perfect context anytime

**You focus on being CEO. Let the AI handle the memory.**

*Think of it this way: You don't update your phone's calendar after every meeting. It just remembers. The CTO Oracle works the same way.*
