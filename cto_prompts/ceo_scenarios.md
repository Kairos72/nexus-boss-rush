# CTO Oracle - CEO Usage Scenarios

## How to Use Your AI CTO (Non-Technical Guide)

Think of the CTO Oracle as your **technical co-founder** who knows everything about the project and gives strategic advice. Here's how you'll use it:

---

## Scenario 1: Daily Check-ins

**You ask:** *"Hey CTO, what's our status today?"*

**CTO Oracle tells you:**
- Current phase (Month 1: Prototype)
- What we're working on (Unity setup)
- Any blockers (none currently)
- Next 3 priorities
- Progress percentage (5% complete)

**Why this helps:** You never have to wonder "what are we doing?"

---

## Scenario 2: Making Strategic Decisions

**You ask:** *"Should we add a co-op mode?"*

**CTO Oracle analyzes:**
- Impact on development timeline (+3 months)
- Technical complexity (networking, sync issues)
- Budget implications (+$25K)
- Mobile performance concerns
- Recommends: "Add in Version 2.0 after launch"

**Why this helps:** You make informed decisions without understanding the code

---

## Scenario 3: When Claude Gets Stuck

**You tell CTO:** *"Claude says the combat doesn't feel good"*

**CTO Oracle suggests:**
- Check input latency (should be <100ms)
- Add haptic feedback
- Review Unity Time.fixedDeltaTime
- Test on actual devices
- Provides specific code recommendations for Claude

**Why this helps:** You can guide technical conversations even if you don't code

---

## Scenario 4: Progress Tracking

**You ask:** *"Are we on schedule for Month 1 milestone?"*

**CTO Oracle reports:**
- Milestone M1: Basic Movement + Combat
- Due: Week 4 (2 weeks remaining)
- Progress: 3 of 5 deliverables complete
- Risk: On track but needs focus
- Recommendation: "Prioritize dodge roll implementation"

**Why this helps:** You stay on top of deadlines without micromanaging

---

## Scenario 5: Marketing Questions

**You ask:** *"What's our core technical differentiator?"*

**CTO Oracle summarizes:**
- 60 FPS on mobile (uncommon for action games)
- <100ms input latency (console-level responsiveness)
- AI-generated art pipeline (reduces cost 60%)
- Mobile-first boss mechanics (industry first)

**Why this helps:** You can market confidently about technical achievements

---

## Scenario 6: Budget Decisions

**You ask:** *"Should we spend $2K on better audio?"*

**CTO Oracle advises:**
- Current audio: Basic sound effects
- Premium audio: Enhanced combat feedback
- Impact: Improves 30% of player experience
- ROI: Higher ratings, better conversion
- Recommendation: "Approve - sound is critical for premium feel"

**Why this helps:** You make budget decisions based on player impact

---

## Scenario 7: When Something Goes Wrong

**You tell CTO:** *"The game crashes on Android"*

**CTO Oracle diagnoses:**
- Likely memory leak (Unity pooling needed)
- Check Android device specifics
- Immediate fix: Add object pooling
- Long-term: Profile with Unity Profiler
- ETA for fix: 2-3 hours

**Why this helps:** You understand problems and solutions quickly

---

## Scenario 8: Planning Next Steps

**You ask:** *"What should we work on next week?"*

**CTO Oracle suggests:**
1. Implement Stone Guardian first boss
2. Add HP bars and combat UI
3. Create 3 basic telegraph patterns
4. Test with 5 playtesters
5. Iterate based on feedback

**Why this helps:** Clear weekly priorities without technical detail

## How to Actually Use It

### Option 1: Through Me (Easiest)
Just ask me: *"Partner, ask the CTO Oracle about..."*

### Option 2: Simple Commands
```bash
# Check status
python -c "from nexus_cto import get_cto_oracle; print(get_cto_oracle().get_status_report())"

# Make decision
python -c "from nexus_cto import get_cto_oracle; cto = get_cto_oracle(); print(cto.make_decision('Add co-op mode?'))"
```

### Option 3: Direct Questions (Coming Soon)
We'll build a simple web interface where you can just type questions!

## What the CTO Oracle Always Considers

When giving advice, the CTO Oracle always asks:

1. **Is this mobile-friendly?** (Performance, controls, battery)
2. **Is this premium quality?** (Worth $12.99)
3. **Does this respect player time?** (No grind)
4. **Can we build this in 8 months?** (Timeline)
5. **Does this enable 'FFXIV raids on mobile'?** (Core vision)

## CEO Success Stories

*"The CTO Oracle told me our combat was running at 30 FPS instead of 60. I asked Claude to fix it, and we found the issue in 2 hours."*

*"I asked if we should add more bosses. CTO Oracle said we'd need to delay launch by 3 months, so we decided to add them as DLC instead."*

*"The CTO Oracle noticed we were spending too much time on UI and not enough on core combat. We refocused and met our milestone."*
