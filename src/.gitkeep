# This directory will contain the Unity project

Once we initialize the Unity project, this directory will contain:
- Assets/ (all game assets and scripts)
- Packages/ (Unity package dependencies)
- ProjectSettings/ (Unity configuration)
- And other Unity-specific files

For now, this is a placeholder to maintain the directory structure.
